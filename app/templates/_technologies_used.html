<h1>Technologies used</h1>
<p>This is my first attempt to create a web application. It serves the purpose of
learning and, at the same time, practicing the following tools,
frameworks, technologies and skills:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Flask web framework</li>
  <li>Jinja2 templating mechanism</li>
  <li>SQLAlchemy Object-Relational Mapper (ORM)</li>
  <li>Python programming language</li>
  <li>HTML + Bootstrap</li>
  <li>Designing database using Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams</li>
  <li>Using MySQL Workbench as a database design tool</li>
  <li>PyUnit testing framework</li>
  <li>UML use-case diagrams</li>
  <li>Elasticsearch (for searching the database)</li>
  <li>Writing software requirements document</li>
  <li>JavaScript (with JQuery - basics of which I learnt during writing the code,
  just as I did with Bootstrap)</li>
  <li>Object-oriented paradigm as well as taking advantage of functions as first-class citizens in both Python and JS</li>
  <li>Basics of Git</li>
  <li>SQLite database</li>
</ul>

<p>I used Emacs for writing most of the code, including Jinja2 templates
(Emacs has also a mode for Jinja2 syntax). Occasionally, I was using
ActiveState Komodo text editor for better html and
JS code formatting.</p>
